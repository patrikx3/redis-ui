## Powerful Online Networking Tool
  
Discover the powerful and free online networking tool at [network.corifeus.com](https://network.corifeus.com)  
    
**Free**   
Designed for professionals and enthusiasts, this tool provides essential features for network analysis, troubleshooting, and management. You can also purchase this tool for integration or as a service.
  
  
## About


**p3x-redis-ui** is a versatile Redis GUI that can function as either a backend server on the web or as a desktop application. This open-source software is particularly effective for managing JSON, featuring integration with JSONEditor and ACE. Explore a variety of options in the 'edit json' button dialog, which also supports uploading and downloading binary data. Additionally, it handles SSH, cluster, and sentinel configurations.

## Features

### Configuration and Security
- **Secure Configuration:** Setup is intricate due to its roots in shared web applications, ensuring that passwords and sensitive data are safeguarded with unique identifiers for both main and node configurations. Node-specific IDs enhance security measures for node passwords.

### Compatibility and Usage
- **Redis Versions and TLS:** Supports Redis 6 with TLS, enhancing security and data integrity.
  - For TLS configuration details, visit [Configuring Redis TLS](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2021/08/05/configuring-redis-tls/).
- **Pika Compatibility:** Compatible with Pika, though not perfectly optimized.
- **SSH Tunneling:** Functional for single instances. Support for cluster and sentinel configurations is under development.
- **Environmental Customizations:** Customize the server port and home directory via `P3XRS_PORT` and `P3XRS_DOCKER_HOME` environment variables.

### Data Handling
- **Binary Data Management:** Special care is needed when handling binary data to prevent issues. Use the download button for binary data; direct editing in text mode is not supported for binary content.
- **Large Data Sets:** Handles values larger than 256 kB, indicated by `[object ArrayBuffer]`. For large values, utilize binary upload and download capabilities.
- **Clipboard Operations:** Text copying is supported directly; binary data requires using the download functionality.

### User Interface and Experience
- **Desktop Shortcuts:** Access menus in the desktop version by pressing ALT.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive, ensuring usability on phones and tablets.
- **Themes:** Choose between Dark - Dracula and light themes for personalized visual comfort.
- **Data Visualization and Management:** 
  - Tree view settings allow adjustments to key count from a minimum of 100 to a maximum of 100,000 to prevent crashes.
  - Deferred rendering in the tree view enhances performance by rendering only what is visible in the viewport.

### Advanced Features
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor all channel messages on the console with a simple checkbox. Console history is stored indefinitely in local storage, keeping the last 20 entries accessible.
- **Database Interaction:** Select databases via the console or a dropdown menu, which also indicates whether databases are empty or filled.
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Client-side mode for searching small sets of keys.
  - Server-side mode for efficient searching within large sets of keys.
  - Search can be configured to start with a specific string or include a string within the keys.

### Network Setup and Extensions
- **Sub-directory Support:** Utilize Nginx/Ingress to rewrite paths when used in a sub-directory.
  - For more information, see [Issue #43](https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui/issues/43).

### Contributions and Support
- **Cluster Support:** Recently added and continuously improving. Contributions by [@devthejo](https://github.com/devthejo) have significantly enhanced this functionality.
- **Community and Feedback:** As this tool evolves, feedback and issue reporting are highly valued to refine and improve the features.

Redis UI provides a powerful interface for managing Redis databases with a focus on security, efficiency, and user experience. Whether you are dealing with small or large data sets, p3x-redis-ui offers robust solutions tailored to meet diverse operational needs.

## Change log
[The change log readme](change-log.md) 


## Releases / Downloadable installer
  
https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui/releases  

## MacOS Compatibility
Our application supports builds for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures.

  
### Handling Downloaded Files from GitHub
Although I'm not an Apple expert, if you download the `zip` file for the `arm64` version, you'll need to execute the following command on the unzipped app to remove the quarantine attribute applied by macOS:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine P3X-Redis-UI.app
```

This command ensures that your system trusts the application, allowing it to run smoothly without security interruptions from macOS.


### Snap

<!--
The main source installer is the `AppImage`, so, the themes are not implemented (the main menus). If you want the themes to be implemented (dark vs light), I suggest using the `AppImage` as it supports the themes natively. Besides, the auto self update function is not implemented in `Snap`, only in `AppImage` version.  
-->

[![LINK](https://cdn.corifeus.com/assets/svg/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/p3x-redis-ui#cory-non-external)

## Flathub
You download from the releases page and install as:
  
```sh
wget https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui/releases/download/v${VERSION}/P3X-Redis-UI-${VERSION}-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak install ./P3X-Redis-UI-${VERSION}-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak run com.patrikx3.redis_ui
```

Besides the menu is integrated.
 

### AppImage, dep, rpm

AppImage, dep and rpm auto update itself.  
  
#### To integrate into the menu using AppImage
Execute:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install appimagelauncher
```


#### After downloading the AppImage, make it an executable.
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/opt
mv ~/Downloads/p3x-redis-ui-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage $HOME/opt/
chmod +x $HOME/opt/p3x-redis-ui-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage
# Then you can run it
$HOME/opt/p3x-redis-ui-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage &
```


<!--
It then actually integrates itself into the menus and it will auto update itself.
-->

### On ElectronJs  
The app can be found on [ElectronJs Apps](https://electronjs.org/apps) and search for `P3X`, you will find it.

### CLI

# Development

For file names do not use camelCase, but use kebab-case. Folder should be named as kebab-case as well. As you can see, all code filenames are using it like that, please do not change that.
Please apply the `.editorconfig` settings in your IDE.

It creates a package that allows you to compose `p3x-redis-ui-server` and `p3x-redis-ui-material` into one:

[Server on GitHub](https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui-server)  
[Client on GitHub](https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui-material)

If you develop on this app, you are required to test, that all JS you code write is working with Electron (as the embedded Electron NodeJs version is usually below the real NodeJs). Once the server and client is running as above, you clone this repo and test like this:
```bash
# terminal 1
git clone https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui-material.git
cd redis-ui-material
npm install
npm run dev

# terminal 2
git clone https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui-server.git
cd redis-ui-server
npm install
npm run dev

# if you are not working on Electron, at this point you can fire the browser
# @ http://localhost:8080/

# terminal 3 
git clone https://github.com/patrikx3/redis-ui.git
cd redis-ui
npm install
./scripts/start-local.sh
# or
.\scripts\start-local.cmd
```

### Development of the translations

By default, only English is created, but given all strings are from a `JS` file, it is very quick to spawn another language eg. German, French, Spanish etc ...

# Solution
  
Interestingly, this solution doesn't employ REST; it opts for Socket.IO instead! üòÑ It might seem a bit unconventional, but I actually appreciate the choice. Using Socket.IO is expected to be more responsive, as it avoids the significant overhead associated with the HTTP protocol. This approach should provide a smoother and faster interaction experience.
